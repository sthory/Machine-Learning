# Model Evaluation and Validation
## Project: Predicting Boston Housing Prices

### Install

This project requires **Python** and the following Python libraries installed:

- [NumPy](http://www.numpy.org/)
- [Pandas](http://pandas.pydata.org/)
- [matplotlib](http://matplotlib.org/)
- [scikit-learn](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/)

You will also need to have software installed to run and execute a [Jupyter Notebook](http://ipython.org/notebook.html)

If you do not have Python installed yet, it is highly recommended that you install the [Anaconda](http://continuum.io/downloads) distribution of Python, which already has the above packages and more included. 

In this project many techniques are used to train, test, evaluate and optimize models, available in Sklearn. Data and characteristics are explored and observed. They train and test models. Potential problems are identified, such as errors due to biases or variations. Techniques are applied to improve the model, such as cross validation and grid search.
