# Predict Stock Prices in Python with TensorFlow 2

Price prediction is an attractive topic for investors and researchers alike.

Investors want to know whether or not the price of a stock will go up, and since there are many complicated financial indicators that only investors and financially savvy people can understand, the trend of the stock market is fluctuating and seems very random to people. no preparation.


Machine learning is a great tool for the inexperienced to accurately predict and earn steady money, and it can also help experts get the most informative indicators and make better predictions.

The purpose of this program is to build a neural network in TensorFlow 2 that can predict stock market prices.

A recurrent neural network is built with LSTM cells, as it is the current state of the art in time series forecasting.
