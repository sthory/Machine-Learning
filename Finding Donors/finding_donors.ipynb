    "## Getting Started\n",
    "\n",
    "In this project, you will employ several supervised algorithms of your choice to accurately model individuals' income using data collected from the 1994 U.S. Census. You will then choose the best candidate algorithm from preliminary results and further optimize this algorithm to best model the data. Your goal with this implementation is to construct a model that accurately predicts whether an individual makes more than $50,000. This sort of task can arise in a non-profit setting, where organizations survive on donations.  Understanding an individual's income can help a non-profit better understand how large of a donation to request, or whether or not they should reach out to begin with.  While it can be difficult to determine an individual's general income bracket directly from public sources, we can (as we will see) infer this value from other publically available features. \n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset for this project originates from the [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Census+Income). The datset was donated by Ron Kohavi and Barry Becker, after being published in the article _\"Scaling Up the Accuracy of Naive-Bayes Classifiers: A Decision-Tree Hybrid\"_. You can find the article by Ron Kohavi [online](https://www.aaai.org/Papers/KDD/1996/KDD96-033.pdf). The data we investigate here consists of small changes to the original dataset, such as removing the `'fnlwgt'` feature and records with missing or ill-formatted entries."

    "For highly-skewed feature distributions such as `'capital-gain'` and `'capital-loss'`, it is common practice to apply a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_transformation_(statistics)\">logarithmic transformation</a> on the data so that the very large and very small values do not negatively affect the performance of a learning algorithm. Using a logarithmic transformation significantly reduces the range of values caused by outliers. Care must be taken when applying this transformation however: The logarithm of `0` is undefined, so we must translate the values by a small amount above `0` to apply the the logarithm successfully.\n",

Applying a scaling to the data does not change the shape of each feature's distribution (such as `'capital-gain'` or `'capital-loss'` above); however, normalization ensures that each feature is treated equally when applying supervised learners. Note that once scaling is applied, observing the data in its raw form will no longer have the same original meaning, as exampled below.\n",
    "\n",
    "Run the code cell below to normalize each numerical feature. We will use [`sklearn.preprocessing.MinMaxScaler`](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.preprocessing.MinMaxScaler.html) for this."

    "From the table in **Exploring the Data** above, we can see there are several features for each record that are non-numeric. Typically, learning algorithms expect input to be numeric, which requires that non-numeric features (called *categorical variables*) be converted. One popular way to convert categorical variables is by using the **one-hot encoding** scheme. One-hot encoding creates a _\"dummy\"_ variable for each possible category of each non-numeric feature. For example, assume `someFeature` has three possible entries: `A`, `B`, or `C`. We then encode this feature into `someFeature_A`, `someFeature_B` and `someFeature_C`.\n",

    "| 2 |  A  |  | 1 | 0 | 0 |\n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, as with the non-numeric features, we need to convert the non-numeric target label, `'income'` to numerical values for the learning algorithm to work. Since there are only two possible categories for this label (\"<=50K\" and \">50K\"), we can avoid using one-hot encoding and simply encode these two categories as `0` and `1`, respectively. In code cell below, you will need to implement the following:\n",
    " - Use [`pandas.get_dummies()`](http://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/generated/pandas.get_dummies.html?highlight=get_dummies#pandas.get_dummies) to perform one-hot encoding on the `'features_log_minmax_transform'` data.\n",

    "### Metrics and the Naive Predictor\n",
    "*CharityML*, equipped with their research, knows individuals that make more than \\$50,000 are most likely to donate to their charity. Because of this, *CharityML* is particularly interested in predicting who makes more than \\$50,000 accurately. It would seem that using **accuracy** as a metric for evaluating a particular model's performace would be appropriate. Additionally, identifying someone that *does not* make more than \\$50,000 as someone who does would be detrimental to *CharityML*, since they are looking to find individuals willing to donate. Therefore, a model's ability to precisely predict those that make more than \\$50,000 is *more important* than the model's ability to **recall** those individuals. We can use **F-beta score** as a metric that considers both precision and recall:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ F_{\\beta} = (1 + \\beta^2) \\cdot \\frac{precision \\cdot recall}{\\left( \\beta^2 \\cdot precision \\right) + recall} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "In particular, when $\\beta = 0.5$, more emphasis is placed on precision. This is called the **F$_{0.5}$ score** (or F-score for simplicity).\n",
    "\n",
    "Looking at the distribution of classes (those who make at most \\$50,000, and those who make more), it's clear most individuals do not make more than \\$50,000. This can greatly affect **accuracy**, since we could simply say *\"this person does not make more than \\$50,000\"* and generally be right, without ever looking at the data! Making such a statement would be called **naive**, since we have not considered any information to substantiate the claim. It is always important to consider the *naive prediction* for your data, to help establish a benchmark for whether a model is performing well. That been said, using that prediction would be pointless: If we predicted all people made less than \\$50,000, *CharityML* would identify no one as donors. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Note: Recap of accuracy, precision, recall\n",
    "\n",
    "** Accuracy ** measures how often the classifier makes the correct prediction. It’s the ratio of the number of correct predictions to the total number of predictions (the number of test data points).\n",
    "\n",
    "** Precision ** tells us what proportion of messages we classified as spam, actually were spam.\n",
    "It is a ratio of true positives(words classified as spam, and which are actually spam) to all positives(all words classified as spam, irrespective of whether that was the correct classificatio), in other words it is the ratio of\n",
    "\n",
    "`[True Positives/(True Positives + False Positives)]`\n",
    "\n",
    "** Recall(sensitivity)** tells us what proportion of messages that actually were spam were classified by us as spam.\n",
    "It is a ratio of true positives(words classified as spam, and which are actually spam) to all the words that were actually spam, in other words it is the ratio of\n",
    "\n",
    "`[True Positives/(True Positives + False Negatives)]`\n",
    "\n",
    "For classification problems that are skewed in their classification distributions like in our case, for example if we had a 100 text messages and only 2 were spam and the rest 98 weren't, accuracy by itself is not a very good metric. We could classify 90 messages as not spam(including the 2 that were spam but we classify them as not spam, hence they would be false negatives) and 10 as spam(all 10 false positives) and still get a reasonably good accuracy score. For such cases, precision and recall come in very handy. These two metrics can be combined to get the F1 score, which is weighted average(harmonic mean) of the precision and recall scores. This score can range from 0 to 1, with 1 being the best possible F1 score(we take the harmonic mean as we are dealing with ratios)."

    "**Answer: **\n",
    "\n",
    "**1. Logistic Regression:**\n",
    "\n",
    "*    - Real world apliccation: Application of logistic regression for fault analysis in an industrial printing process. The method uses binary data, the production process is divided into two categories, rejected or accepted. The objective is to predict future fault incidents by analyzing current measurements from sensors of machine parts. An individual analysis for each type of failure can determine the parts of the plant that influence the failures. The measurable process parameters that do not have a great influence on the production of faults can be inferred. The analysis information can be used to interpret the current state of the plant. Using the predictions, corrective actions can be taken to prevent possible failures. The algorithm is implemented as part of an applied self-learning expert system.\n",
    "Reference: https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/245054.\n",
    "\n",
    "    - Strengths: The results of the algorithm have a good probabilistic interpretation and can be regularized to avoid overfitting. Logistic models can be easily updated with new data using the stochastic gradient descent.\n",
    "    - When does it perform well? The results of the algorithm have a good probabilistic interpretation and can be regularized to avoid overfitting. Logistic models can be easily updated with new data using the stochastic gradient descent.\n",
    "    - Weaknesses: tends to have a lower performance when there are multiple or non-linear decision limits. They are not flexible enough to naturally capture more complex relationships.\n",
    "    - What makes this model a good candidate for the problem? Logistic regression can be a good solution because you have a large enough data set to produce a reliable model. In this way, the model can be robust against the non-linear limits of the classification.**\n",
    "    \n",
    "    \n",
    "**2. KNN (K-Nearest Neighbours):**\n",
    "\n",
    "*    - Real world apliccation: Applied predicting Economic Events.\n",
    "The nearest k-Neighbor classification model has been\n",
    "used for the economic forecast. Prediction models of financial distress have been one of the most attractive areas of financial research. After the global financial crisis, the number of bankrupt companies has increased. Since the financial crisis of companies is the first stage of bankruptcy, financial indicators serve to predict financial difficulties. Recent studies show that this model is more capable than other methods.\n",
    "Reference: https://www.ijera.com/papers/Vol3_issue5/DI35605610.pdf\n",
    "\n",
    "    - Strengths: Simple algorithm, it has a High precision (relatively)and it is versatile, it is used for classification or regression.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    - When does it perform well?: It works well in small data sets with linear and non-linear classification limits also for large data sets. \n",
    "    \n",
    " - Weaknesses: KNN depends on the K value (number of nearest neighbors) There is no easy way to determine the value of K. For very large data sets, KNN performs intensive computations due to the large number of distance calculations.\n",
    " \n",
    " - What makes this model a good candidate for the problem? Because the data set is not very large and therefore the computation cost will be relatively small\n",

    "\n",
    "*    - Real world apliccation: A Classification Framework Applied to Cancer Gene Expression Profiles.\n",
    "We analyze the supervised learning techniques that have been used to classify cancers, with good classification performance compared to other classifiers. Various types of genomic data are incorporated, which increases the accuracy of the prediction.\n",
    "Reference: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3873740/\n",
    "\n",
    "    - Strengths: It produces solid learning outcomes and overfitting is not universal, it works well with small datasets.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    - When does it perform well?: SVM can efficiently perform a non-linear classification using what is called the kernel trick, implicitly mapping its entries into high-dimensional feature spaces.\n",
    "    \n",
    " - Weaknesses: Since the model must be of two classes, training takes more time for large data sets..\n",
    " \n",
    " - What makes this model a good candidate for the problem? It is a good candidate for the problem, because it is a classification problem and the number of data is relatively small. SVM can also help establish a reliable relationship between the output and each input variable given its high learning efficiency.\n",

    "If we see the F-Score results, although the KNN model is the one that behaves best in training, in tests it is really the worst. The models of SVM and Logistic Regression have a better performance in the tests, they are very even, but the SVM takes more time in the training, the logistic regression is faster in the learning process.  \n",
    "The algorithm's suitability for the data: KNN tends to adjust the training data while the linear limit generally generalizes the data well. Viewing the results of the tests, the logistic algorithm works well with the data, since the linear classification limit generalizes the data well.\n",

    "Logistic regression is the model that best works in this case to classify people with incomes of more than $ 50,000. Logistic regression gives us a probability that a given entry belongs to a class. It does not say to what class the entry belongs, the logistic regression gives a probability like 0.7 for class 1 and 0.3 for class 2, for example. Then it is based on the probability value to determine the classification. Learning the logistic model means getting the best line to separate two kinds of data. Therefore, having entries on both sides of the line, the logistic regression value will be high for one class and low for another. If the entry is close to the limit, the logistic regression value will be close to 0.5 for both classes."

With less features required to train, the expectation is that training and prediction time is much lower — at the cost of performance metrics. From the visualization above, we see that the top five most important features contribute more than half of the importance of **all** features present in the data. This hints that we can attempt to *reduce the feature space* and simplify the information required for the model to learn. The code cell below will use the same optimized model you found earlier, and train it on the same training set *with only the top five important features*. "
